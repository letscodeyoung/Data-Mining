# Data-Mining

Data mining based on glucose levels from Artificial Pancreas System sensor
Part1
Extracting Time Series Properties of Glucose Levels in Artificial Pancreas Project
● Extract feature data from a data set.
● Synchronize data from two sensors.
● Compute and report overall statistical measures from data.

Part2
Use a training dataset to train and test a machine model. The purpose is to distinguish between meal and no meal time series data.
● Develop code to train a machine model.
● Assess the accuracy of a machine model.

Part3
Apply the cluster validation technique to data extracted from a provided data set.
● Develop code that performs clustering.
● Test and analyze the results of the clustering code.
● Assess the accuracy of the clustering using SSE and supervised cluster validity metrics.
